Assignment 4 - Off to Never Never Land

It does the thing with the thing while the thing does the thing.  Move around the world, theres a sky box

No real bugs, the lighting is quite bright

Took about 6-7 hours to complete

8/10 I wouldn't have been able to do it without the labs

8/10 It was really overwelming but once I got my footing I enjoyed it
